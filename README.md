### Other

Additionally, extra assets such as fonts or images may be used. For the actual licensing information, refer to the licenses/ folder.

Note that some SIL OFL fonts are licensed separately, since they are not compatible under GNU GPL v3. Dependencies are not included directly in source code, but are referenced by CMake. All source code is written by me, and is therefore under GPLv3.
