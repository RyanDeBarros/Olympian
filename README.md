# Olympian
Olympian Engine is an OpenGL framework to make future graphics projects easier, faster, and safer.

## Licensing
This project uses the following libraries:

- **nigels-com/glew**
- **GLFW**
- **g-truc/glm**
- **nothings/stb**
- **marzer/tomlplusplus**
- **memononen/nanosvg**
- **sasamil/Quartic**

Additionally, extra assets such as fonts or images may be used.
For the actual licensing information, refer to the licenses folder.

Note that some SIL OFL fonts are licensed separately, since they are not compatible under GNU GPL v3. Dependencies are not included directly in source code, but are referenced by CMake. All source code is written by me, and is therefore under GPLv3.
