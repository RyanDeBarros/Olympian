# Olympian
Olympian Engine is an GLFW/OpenGL framework to make future graphics projects easier, faster, and safer. For this project, I'm also writing a [design manual](https://docs.google.com/document/d/186rgx-V7eJ7qQJLzzKFEDsNHN2lNX5ptwvy6lPVgLIU/edit?usp=sharing), at least for the planning phase, so that it can be better designed.
